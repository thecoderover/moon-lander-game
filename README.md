# Moon Lander Game in JavaScript

This is an implementation of a Moon Lander Game in JavaScript. It recreates the basic experience of the classic games of old and was done as a small instructive project only.
A Node-JS static page is provided to view the game, though it is run only on the client-side. As such any backend could be used. The game itself
can be found in the public folder. The instructions below assume you wish to go ahead and use Node-JS.

The game ends when you either land smoothly, crash or fly offscreen. If you are going too fast or your lander is not sufficiently level then warning lights will appear. Good Luck!
